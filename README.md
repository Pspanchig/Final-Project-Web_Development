# Final Project Proposal - Student and Professor Portal
## Introduction

The goal of this project is to build a comprehensive portal for educational purposes that serves both students and professors. The platform will feature separate log-in and account creation functionalities for students and professors. To maintain exclusivity for educators, professor account creation will require a special code. Professors will have the ability to assign homework, and form student groups. Students will have a dashboard to view assignments, submit work, and collaborate with peers.

This project is motivated by the need for a unified platform that simplifies communication and assignment distribution in an educational environment. It aims to streamline the academic workflow and foster a collaborative space for both teaching and learning.
